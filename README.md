# Lib: Linked Lists in Java
Hi folks,
This project is a implementation of various linked lists in Java.
Mainly I made this to practice but feel free to contribute or just to learn
from the code I've written.

Class Hierarchy: List (abstract) > LinearList (abstract) > SimpleList, BidirectionalList

Class Hierarchie:  ListElement (abstract) > LinearListElement (abstract) > SimpleListElement, BidirectionalListElement
