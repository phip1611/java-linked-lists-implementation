# Lib: Phip Linked Lists for Java
Hi folks,
This project is a implementation of various linked lists in Java.
Mainly I made this to practice but feel free to contribute or just to learn
from the code I've written. Actually I became a big fan of my BidirectionalList
implementation because it offers a lot of functionality and many methods
such as pop() (to use it as a stack), several delete-methods and much more!

Class Hierarchy: List (abstract) > LinearList (abstract) > SimpleList, BidirectionalList

Class Hierarchie:  ListElement (abstract) > LinearListElement > BidirectionalListElement
