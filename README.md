# Lib: Phip Linked Lists for Java
Hi folks,
This project is a implementation of various linked lists in Java.
Mainly I made this to practice but feel free to contribute or just to learn
from the code I've written. Actually I became a big fan of my BidirectionalList
implementation because it offers a lot of functionality and many methods
such as pop() (to use it as a stack), several delete-methods and many more!
SimpleList is just a demonstration, you should never use it because it
is really slow. Have fun and let me know what you think: Suggestions or
questions please to Philipp.Schuster@phip1611.de

For a very simple case where you can use one of my lists for example
have a look at this: https://gist.github.com/phip1611/bbb4e461d57bcbee52c21900e753b21a


Class Hierarchy: List (abstract) > LinearList (abstract) > SimpleList, BidirectionalList
